Procurement is a Windows application for the online game Path Of Exile, that logs in to the forum and downloads your characters/stash. From there you can:

  * Search/filter your stash/tabs for gear/items
  * Search for gear based on item stats
  * Show where items are in your stash, that form part of vendor recipes
  * View your characters/gear
  * Oneclick generate forum trade posts that you can copy&paste into a trade post, which will have all your gear linked, verified and categorised in spoiler tags.
  * Customise how your shop thread gets generated
  * Breakdown of your currency with GCP total (Ratios configurable)
  * Everything is cached and can be viewed offline after you've logged in once
  * Single tab refreshing (if logged in)
